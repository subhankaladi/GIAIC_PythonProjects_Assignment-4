# Python Assignments Overview

## 00 - Introduction & Basic Python Scripts
This section provides an introduction to Python, covering basic concepts such as syntax, variables, how to run Python scripts, printing output, taking user input, and simple calculations.

## 01 - Expressions
Expressions in Python include mathematical operations, logical conditions, and variable manipulations to create meaningful computations.

## 02 - Lists
Lists are an essential data structure in Python. This section covers list creation, indexing, slicing, appending, and common list operations.

## 04 - If Statements
Conditional statements allow decision-making in programs. This section explains `if`, `elif`, and `else` conditions for executing code based on logical expressions.

## 03 - Dictionaries
Dictionaries store key-value pairs. This section explores creating dictionaries, accessing values, adding/removing items, and looping through dictionary elements.

## 05 - Loops & Control Flow
Loops enable repetitive tasks in Python. This section covers `for` and `while` loops, along with control flow mechanisms like `break` and `continue`.

## 06 - Functions
Functions allow code reusability and modular programming. This section discusses defining functions, passing arguments, and returning values.

## 07 - Information Flow
Information flow refers to how data moves within a program. This section covers variable scope, data passing between functions, and best practices for organizing code.
